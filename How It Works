#  AI-Driven Cab Booking Automation for Routematic

## 📌 Problem Statement

In many colleges and corporate campuses, students and employees depend on **Routematic** for daily cab transportation. The booking system has strict constraints:

- Cab for **tomorrow must be booked before 12:00 AM today**
- Booking is done manually through a **multi-step mobile app flow**
- If a user forgets to book on time, **no cab is assigned**
- On holidays or blocked days, booking is not allowed
- There is **no reminder or auto-booking feature**

This creates a **real, recurring problem** faced by many students and working professionals.

---

## 🎯 Why This Is a Real-World Problem

Students and interns often:
- Return late from classes, labs, or projects
- Manage academic work along with internships
- Miss the narrow booking window unintentionally

Missing a booking results in:
- Last-minute expensive transport
- Stress and inconvenience
- Punctuality and attendance issues

This is not an edge case — **it happens daily to many users**.

---

## ❌ Why Existing Solutions Are Insufficient

- Routematic does **not provide any auto-booking option**
- There is **no public API** to integrate with
- Manual booking requires:
  - Navigating the calendar
  - Identifying the next working day
  - Filling multiple dropdowns
  - Saving within a strict time window
- Simple reminders are unreliable because the user still needs to perform every step correctly before midnight

---

## 🤖 How AI Helps Solve This Problem

We designed an **AI-driven, context-aware automation agent** that behaves like a **responsible human user** rather than a simple script.

### The AI Does NOT:
- Reverse engineer the application
- Use private or unauthorized APIs
- Bypass business rules
- Book outside allowed time windows

### The AI DOES:
- Observe the app’s UI in real time
- Understand which screen is currently visible
- Make decisions based on UI state
- Verify every action before proceeding
- Respect booking rules, holidays, and constraints

---

## 🧠 Why This Is AI and Not a Script

This solution is **not a blind click bot**.

It uses **state-based reasoning** and **context awareness**, similar to how a human interacts with the app:

- Detects current screen (Home, Calendar, Form)
- Identifies valid working days
- Skips weekends and holidays
- Reads current field values before changing them
- Verifies that selections were applied successfully
- Retries intelligently if an action fails
- Exits gracefully when booking is not allowed

The system is implemented as a **finite state machine**, where each state:
- Observes UI context
- Decides the next action
- Confirms success before transitioning

---

## 🛠️ Technical Approach

### Core Design
- Android **Accessibility Service**
- **Finite State Machine** based automation
- Event-driven UI detection (no fixed delays)
- Read-after-write verification
- Fail-safe retries and timeouts

### Key Capabilities
- Launches Routematic reliably
- Navigates to the calendar automatically
- Identifies the **next valid working day**
- Skips weekends and holidays
- Fills booking details only when needed
- Confirms booking success visually
- Stops safely when booking is not permitted

---

## ⏰ Scheduling & Safety

- Runs automatically before midnight
- Respects Routematic’s booking window
- Does not attempt booking on holidays
- Requires minimal user interaction (notification-based launch)

---

## 🌍 Real-World Impact

This project addresses a **daily operational pain point**:

- Prevents missed cab bookings
- Reduces stress and mental load
- Saves money on last-minute transport
- Improves punctuality and reliability

It demonstrates how **AI automation can improve everyday life**, not just serve as a theoretical demo.

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings & Innovation

- AI can operate **within strict system constraints**
- Accessibility can be used **ethically and responsibly**
- State-based reasoning significantly improves reliability
- Real-world automation requires verification, not assumptions

---

## 🏁 Summary

We built an **AI-driven, context-aware automation system** to solve a **real, recurring transportation problem** faced by students and professionals.

Instead of bypassing systems, the AI agent is designed to:
- Observe
- Decide
- Act
- Verify
- Fail safely

This makes the solution **robust, ethical, and genuinely useful in real-world scenarios**.
